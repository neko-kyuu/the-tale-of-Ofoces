#kyuu: How do you evaluate Wiro? In my setting, he is not often at home. What could be the possible reasons for him long term absence?

总的来说gpt给出了两点我觉得还可以的：哲学或魔法追求和旅行癖。

他的旅行可能会带他去被遗忘的国度、与世隔绝的魔法圣地，甚至穿越时空 —— 穿越时空看起来就像个传奇法术，鉴于不受时间静止的影响都是需要数个法师共同完成的仪式，穿越时空的难度应该不是什么单人能做到的吧，说到底有这个法术吗？

不过龙枪可以写依赖装置进行时间旅行，所以如果有这种装置的话，弗洛温家没什么理由不可以得到，但……动机怎么设置，纯粹的好奇吗？

gpt引出了一个问题：如何看待他和伊斯的关系会受到这次缺席的影响。

1. **Philosophical Pursuits or Magical Research**: Wiro might be on a personal journey of discovery, either in pursuit of knowledge or magical mastery. As a highly capable mage from a prestigious family, he could be searching for deeper arcane knowledge, perhaps related to planar travel or ancient magical artifacts. This would be consistent with his easy-going demeanor—he wouldn't feel compelled to explain his absences to his family.
2. **Exploration and Wanderlust**: Given his easy-going nature, Wiro might simply be a wanderer at heart. The world outside may call to him, and he might enjoy traveling for the sake of new experiences, magic, or simply to escape the responsibilities of family life. This could range from small, secluded villages where he is studying local customs to distant, unexplored regions of the world, perhaps even distant planes.
