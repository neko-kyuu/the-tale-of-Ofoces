That combination makes for an intriguing character. Wiro could be constantly chasing new magical discoveries or seeking out rare arcane knowledge, all while indulging his natural wanderlust. His travels might take him to forgotten realms, isolated magical sanctuaries, or even across planes, driven by his thirst for both adventure and deeper mystical understanding. This would align with his easy-going nature—he's not bound by the responsibilities of home and family, yet he’s on a personal journey that only he understands. How do you envision his relationship with Ilse being affected by this absence?

To be honest, I think there are problems with Wiro's educational approach. This does not mean that he is not good at teaching others, on the contrary, as an older elf, he has rich experience and excellent communication skills. The problem may lie in his overindulgence of Ilse, causing some of his behaviors to be less calm than usual. And Ilse, I think he is independent and arrogant, and doesn't mind his father's absence. What is your opinion? I don't mind if you have different ideas, please let me know.

I think you're on the right track with this dynamic. Wiro’s overindulgence might be less about the quantity of attention and more about the quality—he gives Ilse too much freedom, indulging him to the point where Ilse has developed a sense of entitlement and a lack of responsibility. This creates a paradox: Wiro is very capable of teaching and guiding others, yet when it comes to his own son, he’s either too lenient or too passive in providing boundaries. It’s not that Wiro isn’t aware of his own flaws, but his desire to avoid confrontation or to preserve his own freedom may result in him letting Ilse off too easily, reinforcing bad habits.

As for Ilse, his independence and arrogance are key to understanding his reaction to his father's absence. His sense of superiority and the belief that he can navigate life without needing his father’s presence is natural for someone who has been given everything and never truly had to face consequences for his actions. He probably sees his father's absence as a sign of personal freedom, rather than neglect. This actually might work in both of their favor—Wiro is able to pursue his own ambitions without guilt, while Ilse has the space to assert his own will, further fueling his arrogance.

However, there could also be some subtle underlying feelings in Ilse, like a desire for approval or recognition that he might not openly admit. Perhaps part of his arrogance masks a need for affirmation—after all, even if he’s independent, being ignored by his father for extended periods might lead to a quiet frustration, though not in a way that would make him overtly resentful.

In this setup, it’s also possible that while Wiro’s absence doesn’t faze Ilse outwardly, it might create moments of introspection for him, particularly when he encounters challenges that require emotional depth or guidance—something that Wiro’s absence leaves him lacking.

In essence, this strained yet independent relationship between them could create tension without the need for overt conflict. Both characters remain content in their respective roles, but the cracks in their relationship could slowly grow, showing up in small, seemingly insignificant ways. Would you like to explore this tension more, or perhaps focus on how it influences the story's larger events?
