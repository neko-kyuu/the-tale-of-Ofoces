To be honest, I think there are problems with Wiro's educational approach. This does not mean that he is not good at teaching others, on the contrary, as an older elf, he has rich experience and excellent communication skills. The problem may lie in his overindulgence of Ilse, causing some of his behaviors to be less calm than usual. And Ilse, I think he is independent and arrogant, and doesn't mind his father's absence. What is your opinion? I don't mind if you have different ideas, please let me know.

gpt表示维洛的溺爱——他给了伊斯太多的自由，放纵他，以至于伊斯产生了一种权利感和缺乏责任感。这就产生了一个悖论：维洛非常有能力教导和指导他人，但当涉及到自己的儿子时，他在提供界限方面要么过于宽容，要么过于被动。并不是说维洛没有意识到自己的缺陷，而是他避免对抗或维护自己自由的愿望可能会导致他太容易放过伊斯，从而强化坏习惯。

这段没什么毛病，额外补充一点原因，我觉得维洛也不太习惯当父亲。

gpt指出的他们关系中的裂缝，我倒觉得微乎其微，这对父子的关系有着相当松弛的距离感，考虑到他们两个的喜好，这或许堪称完美的距离。我更多的是想关注于维洛对伊斯的影响，但是首先，什么算是好的教育？

I think you're on the right track with this dynamic. Wiro’s overindulgence might be less about the quantity of attention and more about the quality—he gives Ilse too much freedom, indulging him to the point where Ilse has developed a sense of entitlement and a lack of responsibility. This creates a paradox: Wiro is very capable of teaching and guiding others, yet when it comes to his own son, he’s either too lenient or too passive in providing boundaries. It’s not that Wiro isn’t aware of his own flaws, but his desire to avoid confrontation or to preserve his own freedom may result in him letting Ilse off too easily, reinforcing bad habits.

As for Ilse, his independence and arrogance are key to understanding his reaction to his father's absence. His sense of superiority and the belief that he can navigate life without needing his father’s presence is natural for someone who has been given everything and never truly had to face consequences for his actions. He probably sees his father's absence as a sign of personal freedom, rather than neglect. This actually might work in both of their favor—Wiro is able to pursue his own ambitions without guilt, while Ilse has the space to assert his own will, further fueling his arrogance.

However, there could also be some subtle underlying feelings in Ilse, like a desire for approval or recognition that he might not openly admit. Perhaps part of his arrogance masks a need for affirmation—after all, even if he’s independent, being ignored by his father for extended periods might lead to a quiet frustration, though not in a way that would make him overtly resentful.

In this setup, it’s also possible that while Wiro’s absence doesn’t faze Ilse outwardly, it might create moments of introspection for him, particularly when he encounters challenges that require emotional depth or guidance—something that Wiro’s absence leaves him lacking.

In essence, this strained yet independent relationship between them could create tension without the need for overt conflict. Both characters remain content in their respective roles, but the cracks in their relationship could slowly grow, showing up in small, seemingly insignificant ways. Would you like to explore this tension more, or perhaps focus on how it influences the story's larger events?
